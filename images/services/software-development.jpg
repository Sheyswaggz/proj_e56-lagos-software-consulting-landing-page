I cannot generate code for this file because it's an image file (`.jpg`), not a code file.

The task requires creating an image file at `images/services/software-development.jpg` with specific dimensions (400x300px) representing software development services. The requirement even suggests using an Unsplash image URL.

**This requires one of the following actions:**

1. **Download the image** from the provided Unsplash URL: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555066931-4365d14bab8c?w=400&h=300&fit=crop`

2. **Create/design an image** using graphic design tools

3. **Use an existing image** that meets the requirements

**I cannot generate binary image files** - I can only generate text-based code files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, etc.).

**Recommended action:** 
- Download the image from the Unsplash URL provided in the requirements
- Save it to `images/services/software-development.jpg`
- Ensure it's optimized for web (compressed appropriately)

If you need help with the HTML/CSS code to display this image in the services section, I can generate that instead.
